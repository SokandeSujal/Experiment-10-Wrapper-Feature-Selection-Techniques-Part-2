# Wine Quality Classification with Feature Selection

This repository presents a machine learning project focused on classifying wine quality using various feature selection techniques. We implement Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) to optimize feature selection and compare their performance.

## 1. Dataset Overview

The *Wine Quality* dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 11 input features and one target variable (quality), which we convert into a binary classification.

- **Features**: 11 characteristics related to wine (e.g., acidity, alcohol).
- **Target Variable**: `quality` â€“ binary classification (1 = good quality, 0 = poor quality).
- **Size**: 1599 samples.

### Loading the Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url, delimiter=';')

# Binarize target variable for classification
df['quality'] = df['quality'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >= 6 else 0)

# Dataset overview
df.info()
df.head()
```

## 2. Wrapper Technique Implementation

### Genetic Algorithms (GA)

Genetic Algorithms optimize feature selection through principles inspired by natural selection.

#### Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Prepare data
X = df.drop(columns='quality')
y = df['quality']

# GA setup and execution...
```

#### Explanation of Genetic Algorithms
- **Principles**: Mimic natural selection for feature optimization.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Based on accuracy, guiding feature subset optimization.

### Simulated Annealing (SA)

Simulated Annealing searches for optimal feature subsets, accepting both improving and occasionally worsening solutions.

#### Implementation

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import math

# Initialize model and parameters
base_model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
# SA function implementation...
```

#### Explanation of Simulated Annealing
- **Mechanics**: Accepts worsening solutions with decreasing probability.
- **Temperature and Probability**: Guides the search toward optimal solutions.

## 3. Comparison with Part 1

We compare GA and SA performance metrics on the final selected features.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **GA Metrics**: 
  - Accuracy: 1.0
  - Precision: 1.0
  - Recall: 1.0
  - F1 Score: 1.0

- **SA Metrics**: 
  - Accuracy: 1.0
  - Precision: 1.0
  - Recall: 1.0
  - F1 Score: 1.0
